To use this software you need android studio installed correctly. I built this software in android studio
at "https://developer.android.com/studio/". Refer there about installing android studio correctly.
I have kept all dependency in gradle section in file.

You need to install Jdk 8(might work with Jdk 7 too) or more or tick option of use embedded jdk.
After it is installed clone this repo to your studio from the options shown in android studio.

If you got sync error and a error with error code 216, goto File -> Project Structure -> SDK location
1) If ticking 'Use embedded JDK' does not work
2) Untick it and choose the JDK path there which is under Java folder in your pc and point in JDK location

Great!!!
You installed the project perfectly.
Press green run button in android studio to run the program.

All the SDK and dependencies comes with this software with exact version.
Please check build.gradle file in root folder and build.gradle file in root/app.

You are good to go.
